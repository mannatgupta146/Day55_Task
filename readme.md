# Day 55 Task | Cohort 2.0

This project is my **Day 55 Task**, where I created an interactive **Anchor-Based Hover Highlight UI** using **HTML, SCSS, and the CSS Anchor Positioning API**.  
When the user hovers over any colored box, a dynamic highlight automatically moves to that box using CSS Anchors, creating a smooth and modern hover-follow effect.

## 🎥 Demo
Below is a quick preview of how the animation looks:

## 📌 About the Day 55 Task
Day 55 focused on understanding the **CSS Anchor Positioning API**, which allows elements to position themselves relative to others without using JavaScript. I learned how to:

- Use `anchor-name` and `position-anchor` to link UI elements  
- Move an element (highlight) dynamically using anchors  
- Apply `:has()` to control hover and scaling states  
- Use SCSS nesting to maintain clean and readable styling  
- Build hover animations entirely with CSS, no JS needed  

## ✨ Task Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🎯 **Dynamic Anchor Highlight** | A white highlight moves smoothly to the hovered box. |
| 📦 **Scale-on-Hover Effect** | The hovered box enlarges while others shrink slightly. |
| 🧩 **CSS Anchor Positioning** | The entire effect works without JavaScript. |
| 🎨 **Clean, Minimal Interface** | Aesthetic layout with smooth transitions. |
| 🧱 **SCSS Nesting** | Organized and maintainable styling. |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML  
- SCSS  
- CSS Anchor Positioning  
- VS Code  

## 📖 Learning Outcome

By completing this task, I learned:

- How the **CSS Anchor Positioning API** works  
- How to dynamically align one element with another based on hover  
- How `:has()` enables parent-level hover detection  
- How SCSS nesting improves styling structure  
- How advanced CSS can replace JavaScript for UI animations  

## 🌟 Acknowledgement

This **Day 55 task** helped me dive deeper into modern CSS features and build fully interactive UI effects without JavaScript.  
Thank you to **Cohort 2.0** for continuing to provide creative, hands-on design challenges.
