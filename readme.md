# Day 55 Task | Cohort 2.0

This project is my **Day 54 Task**, where I created a glowing **Rotating Conic-Gradient Border Card UI** using **HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript**.  
When the user hovers over the card, the border begins to rotate smoothly, creating an electric, dynamic effect that highlights the Pikachu card.

## 🎥 Demo
